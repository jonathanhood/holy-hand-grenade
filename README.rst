  Holy Hand Grenade Fantasy Football Draft Manager  

The holy hand grenade was an attempt to optimize my draft picks given my
complete lack of knowledge about fantasy football in general. It presents
a small CLI that so that users may enter the current state of the draft as
it happens - and then query for what the "next best pic" is.
